Input format: This program takes a file name as an argument from the command line. The file
is either blank or contains successive lines of input. Each line contains a character, either ‘i’ or ‘d’, followed by a tab character and then an integer. For each of the lines that starts with ‘i’, your program should insert that number in the linked list in sorted order if it is not already there. Your program should not insert any duplicate values. If the line starts with a ‘d’, your program should delete the value if it is present in the linked list. Your program should silently ignore the line if the requested value is not present in the linked list.

Output format: At the end of the execution, your program should print the number of nodes
in the list in the first line of the output and all the values of the linked list in sorted order in the next line. The values should be in a single line separated by tabs. There should be no leading or trailing white spaces in the output. Your program should print “error” (and nothing else) if the file does not exist. Your program should print 0 followed by a blank line if the input file is empty or the resulting linked list has no nodes.
