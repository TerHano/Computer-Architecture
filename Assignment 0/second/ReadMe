Your program will take the file name as input.
The first line in the file provides total number of values in the array. The second line will contain a list of numbers separated by tabs:
For example, a sample input file “file1.txt” is:
5
12 54 10 4 8

Your output will be the sorted list of numbers, each separated by tab.
$./second file1.txt 4 8 10 12 54
