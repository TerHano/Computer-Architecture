Input format: This program takes a file name as argument from the command line. The file contains successive lines of input. Each line contains a character, either ‘i’ or ‘s’, followed by a tab and then an integer. For each line that starts with ‘i’, your program should insert that number in the hash table if it is not present. If the line starts with a ‘s’, your program should search the hash table for that value.
Output format: For each line in the input file, your program should print the status/result
of that operation. For an insert, the program should print “inserted” if the value is inserted or “duplicate” if the value is already present. For a search, the program should print ”present” or “absent” based on the outcome of the search. You can assume that the program inputs will have proper structure.
